""" Classes to implement a (simulated) movie list.

E.g. "My List" on Netflix

Note that the movies, TV series, etc. exist as independent objects, stored
elsewhere in the system. What we are doing with MyMovieList is linking them
together so that we can recall them and browse them.

For this to work in a single programming exercise, we are including the
definition of the Movie class, and in the test methods we may create some
new movie objects.

For CS2515 labs on DoublyLinked Lists

Stub file - the implementation of the class MyMovieList needs to be
completed.

# But you don't have to put anything here - it is fine to implement it
