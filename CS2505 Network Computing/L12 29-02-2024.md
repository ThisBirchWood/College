- No centralized server
	- Better from a privacy standpoint, due to not going through a server that could track you
- Possibly not stable, due to depending on other PCs that could shut down at any moment
```slide-note
page: 93-95
```
- Once a user gets a copy of a file, they agree to become a server for that file
- First term is the amount of the time it takes to upload to server
	- Second term is the amount of time it takes the slowest client to download the file
	- Third term is the amount of time on aggregate for all of the clients/peers to download the file
- So when someone goes to P2P to download a file, someone could make 1000 requests to download a file
	- Instead of a singular server taking 1000 requests all at once, these 1000 requests could be distributed to a bunch of different users
```slide-note

```
- People are "volunteers" in BitTorrent, they have volunteered to distribute a file
- Files are split into pieces so that you are less dependent on a singular peer
```slide-note

```
- The file must be made available somewhere, this is known as the *seed* node
	- If everyone uses the *seed* node, it's basically a client-server model
```slide-note

```
- Tracker will give client a list of peers that have the file they're looking for
```slide-note

```
- You may also change your upload speed as you leave it in the background
	- Good neighbour / Bad neighbour
- Torrenting wouldn't be used for day-to-day operations, such as browsing, as it could be inconsistent
```slide-note

```
- The reason for randomly selecting someone every 30 seconds is because this might be their first time downloading something
```slide-note
page: 102-104
```
- Significant overhead
	- Becomes exponentially slower in large networks
```slide-note
page: 107-108
```
- Every peer has a copy of a hash table
