- Purpose of handshakes:
	- To set certain variables
	- Set buffer size
	- Starting sequence number
- TCP picks a random starting seq number so similar connections aren't confused
	- Say you open a TCP connection and then close after sending your packets
	- And then you open one up immediately after closing the last
	- If the sequence numbers started at 0, some inter-connection packets could get confused

- The reason for the timed wait at the end, it to allow time for packets that still may be crossing the internet
```slide-note

```
- With TCP we count bytes rather than packets
- Sequence numbers actually represents the first byte in the segment
