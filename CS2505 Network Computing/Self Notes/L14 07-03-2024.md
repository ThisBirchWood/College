- Video is stored in playout buffer
- x(t) is the rate that the buffer fills up, variable based on the delay
```slide-note

page: 131-132
```
- If variable fill rate is higher than the playout rate, the buffer will fill up and you won't have a stall

```
- All video is retrieved using HTTP
	- HTTP "GETS" a chunk of the video
- This a pull based approach
	- Push based approach used to be used, however was often blocked by firewalls (due to it using UDP + other reasons)
- UDP seems better for video (lower latency)
	- However TCP is used, due to the reasons above
- DASH attempts to fix the buffering issue, by having other available qualities

```
- A Manifest file (.mpd), a list of urls corresponding to the different data rates
- Every video is divided into chunks (between 2 and 10 seconds)
```slide-note

```
- Client decides the quality level, not the server
```slide-note

```
- Transcode = produce a set of the same videos at different qualities
- Transcoding must be done a lot faster when dealing with live video
```slide-note

```
- You are committed to chunks, you can't change a video chunk in your buffer even if your bandwidth increases
	- Other protocols can do this (HLS from Apple)

# Transport Layer
```slide-note
page: 4
```
- Routers don't understand TCP or UDP, they only run on the 3 lower layers
	- Their only job is to forward packets
```slide-note
page:5-6
```
- TCP is important because missing, out-of-order, corrupt packets happen *very* often on the internet
