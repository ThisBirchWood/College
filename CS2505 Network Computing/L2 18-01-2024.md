- Data center no different from personal computers such that they sit on the edge of networks
- Bandwidth can be shared between households, a gigabit shared among 10 people in a neighbour reduces the bandwdith by a factor of 10.
- **Data Rate**: The amount of data that can be transmitted per time unit over a link
	- Example: 10 Megabits a second (Mb/s or mbps) 
	- Bytes sometimes called octets
- **Bandwidth**: (measured in Hertz) refers to the amount of frequency spectrum available on a communication link, which is related to data rate.
- **Attenuation**: Refers to signal degradation
- **Half-Duplex**: Can't receive and transmit data at the same time (wireless)
- **Full-Duplex**: Can receive and transmit at the same time (ethernet)

# Dial-Up
- Uses telephone line, which technically only supports sound
- Converted your bits to sound, hence the sound

# Digital subscriber line (DSL)
- Also uses telephone line
- Uses a different radio frequency, so data rates are higher
	- Uses a special radio frequency that's for transmitting data

# Fibre
- Signal attenuates much more slowly than other standards
- Some places don't get fibre directly to the home, they could get it to the area/region
	- Then use existing telephone lines to transmit the data the rest of the way
## Dark Fibre
- Fibre that isn't used, they put it into the ground in case it were to be used in the future
- When they dig up the roads for whatever reason, they just put in fibre.
