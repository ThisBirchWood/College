# Go Back N
- If you lost packet *n*, it'll send the all the packets after (in the window) and including packet *n*
- Should you receive packet 0 and 1, and if packet two got lost, and then the sender sends packet three
	- The receiver will send ACK0 when it gets packet 0
	- It will send ACK1 when it gets packet 1
	- It will send ACK1 when it gets packet 3
		- This is because it doesn't expect packet 3
		- It sends the **highest** received sequence ACK
		- By implication, the sender will know that packet 2 got lost

# Selective Repeat
- Similar to Go Back N, but not as inefficient as it doesn't resend all the packets.
- When a receiver doesn't expect a certain packet, say it receives packet 2 when it was expecting packet 1, it'll still hold on to packet 2 (it doesn't discard it as Go Back N would)
- The reason there is a window (buffer) as well in the receiver, is due to security reasons (DDOS)

# TCP
- TCP has a 20 byte header
	- Bad if your packet is only 1 byte
