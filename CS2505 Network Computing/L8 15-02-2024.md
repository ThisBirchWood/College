- Day 2 of sending Dylan the notes, I almost couldn't today. Harsh environment, rough conditions but I braved through and perseverance got me through the note writing. Anyway, here are the network notes 
- UDP is lower latency that TCP but is unreliable
- Every HTTP message has headers and Payload (body of message)
- HTTP is an ASCII protocol, has spaces in the header so you can read it
- Three methods for HTTP: GET and POST, HEAD (asks server to leave requested object out of response)
- Content length is in bytes
- Content-Type: text/html (text formatted as html)
- `telnet example.org 80` opens a TCP connection to example.org at port 80
- HTTP has no state so it cannot identify you, however cookies permit identification of users
- Proxy server acts as a cache, stores local copy of each request/response
	- Proxy acts like both a client and a server
- When talking about caches you need to know the hit rate (e.g. 5-10% would not be worth it)
	- How do we deal with cache consistency? e.g. If I keep a local copy what happens if the original version changes
	- HTTP supports that. Conditional GET, I want to get the object but *only* is it has changed
	- Proxies always send conditional GETs
- HTTP caching is not widely used, most servers today include a DO NOT CACHE line, because the content is always changing/customised to the user (e.g. advertisements)
- slope represents propagation delay, height represents transmission delay -slide 50
# FTP
- one of the oldest application layer protocols
- most people use SFTP instead nowadays
- FTP only fetches files
- Separate TCP connections every time you contact the server to do a download, also separate one for the connection
- interactive protocol meant to be used by users
- HTTP and FTP are both ASCII protocols meaning we can read them and print them out (human-readable)
	- Easier to debug and work with scripting languages
- ASCII protocols only every used at application layer
- Every else is binary protocols
	- binary protocols save a lot of space e.g. HTTP/1.1 (8 bytes) can be represented in binary with 2 bits (01)
