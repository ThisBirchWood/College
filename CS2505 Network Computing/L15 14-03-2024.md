- Assume network is reliable
	- More of a thought exercise
```slide-note
page: 27
```
- Channel may produce bit errors in packets
	- We still assume packets don't get lost
	- **Checksum** is used to check
```slide-note

```
- If a NAK/ACK is corrupted, you could retransmit
	- Then you need to handle duplicates
	- By adding sequence numbers
```slide-note
page: 32-33
```
- It sends an **ACK** even when it gets a duplicate
- Sequence numbers are alternating
```slide-note
page: 35-38
```
- RDT3.0 is used in WiFi, and BlueTooth
```slide-note
page: 39-41
```
- Very low util, due to RTTs waiting for every single ACK to come back
```slide-note
page: 43-45
```
- Go-Back-N is not great because there could be packets that have been successfully sent and are just waiting in the receiver's buffer
	- However the sender will still send them again
