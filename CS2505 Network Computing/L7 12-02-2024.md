- We're not too interested in *inter-process communication*, we're looking at different host communication
```slide-note
page: 14
```
- The socket API is the de-facto standard for network communication
	- It's on every device, every operating system
```slide-note
page: 15
```
- *Port Numbers* are used to identify the correct process on a computer
	- Minecraft's default port number: 25565
```slide-note

```
- TCP has rate control, which throttles the sender
- Majority of web traffic is TCP, which will transmit a HTTP request/response
```slide-note
page: 20-23
```
- Because HTTP uses TCP in the underlying transport layer, HTTP is transferred in a reliable manner.
```slide-note
page: 24
```
- Client sends a special message to the server to setup a TCP connection
	- Normally called a *handshake*
	- Server does send a response to this, if the server is up and willing to connect
	- Another *handshake* at the end to end the connection
```slide-note

```
- Sender adds the sequence numbers to the packet itself
```slide-note
page: 26-27
```
- Stateless means that the protocol does not maintain any past history of requests
	- HTTP is stateless
- In old HTTP (HTTP 1.0), a separate TCP connection would have to be created every time a new object/file was requested
	- This resulted in poor performance as websites grew larger with more files and images
	- This is known as nonpersistent HTTP
	- Browsers often opened parallel TCP connections to speed this up
```slide-note

## Non-Persistent Connection
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET html file
- Close TCP connection (handshake)
- Browser looks at HTML file and finds 3 references to JPEG files
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET JPEG file 1
- Close TCP connection (handshake)
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET JPEG file 2
- Close TCP connection (handshake)
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET JPEG file 3
- Close TCP connection (handshake)

- 12 round trip times (RTTs)

## Non-Persistent Parallel Connections
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET html file
- Close TCP connection (handshake)
- Browser looks at HTML file and finds 3 references to JPEG files
- Opens 3 TCP connections (3 handshakes)
- GETS 3 JPEG files from the 3 separate connections
- Closes 3 TCP connections

## Persistent Connections
- Open TCP connection (handshake)
- GET html file
- Browser looks at HTML file and finds 3 references to JPEG files
- GET JPEG 1
- GET JPEG 2
- GET JPEG 3
- Close TCP connection (handshake)

## Pipelining
- Pipelining removes the wait for the response and just sends the HTTP requests one after another
	- Without waiting for a response
