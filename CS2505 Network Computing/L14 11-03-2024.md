- Host 2 is demultiplexing the message

```
- Using different processes to deal with multiple clients is cleaner, however it's very CPU and memory intensive
- Using threads is much more complex to implement, however it's much less CPU and memory intensive

- UDP doesn't control how fast it sends out packets, TCP does
	- UDP can fire packets as fast as your machine can
	- This is why UDP is used in DDOS attacks
