I started by browsing various existing job listing sites and seeing what information was stored about 
users, jobs and companies. (jobs.ie, monster.ie). I went through LinkedIn to see the best attributes that
could be added to the users and jobs tables. LinkedIn was also useful to find attributes to add to companies,
such as where they're based, specialties and employee count. I also viewed this video: 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmYd_Mxc4s&ab_channel=LinkedInHelp), which gave insight into how a company is
added to the LinkedIn database. I could see each of the fields that needed to be filled out, which gave me ideas for company
attributes. I also browsed articles (https://vertabelo.com/blog/designing-a-database-for-an-online-job-portal/) to find
ideas on what extra entities could be added to the database, such as tables for job posts and companies.
