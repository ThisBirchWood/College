- Even modern disks are still quite slow

- Consider a disk
	- RD/WR: tracks at random
		- seek time can be high

- *NOOP* scheduler is the simplest scheduler
	- Say there are multiple different requests
	- If they are adjacent to each other
		- Or in proximity
	- These requests are grouped together
- Reads are of higher priority than writes
	- This is because the CPU must process all the reading
	- But a write can simply be started by the CPU and then it is taken care of
		- Doesn't take up any more CPU power
