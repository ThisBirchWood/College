# OS
## Types
- General purpose OS
- SensorOS (embedded)
- TinyOS
- Mobile OS

## Resource Management
- CPU
- Memory
- I/O Devices

# Process
- An entity that has a life cycle
- Processes can have **child processes**
- Processes can **switch states**:
	- ready -> running
	- process has a **working set** of pages
	- has CPU time, allocated by scheduler

## Threads
- Multiple threads share the same **process context** for which they are a part of

# CPU Scheduler
- Allocates CPU time to processes fairly
- **Load Balancing** is done to balance the load between all the cores
- **Visibility** is very important for *mobile* operating systems

- intent: control switches from a process to another process

## Group Scheduling
- Keep processes and threads that share code/data on the same core
- If new processes are created, and/or the affinity is lost (code changed) then the group scheduling is abandoned
	- That process can be moved to a different core
## Domain Scheduling
- Virtual parallel architectures
- *Domain*: group of cores sharing properties and policies

## Mobile Devices
- Cores can be of the same type, or there can be a heterogenous config, (big.LITTLE)
- Big cores working at high frequency, consume lots of energy, used when load is high
	- Little cores working at low freq, low energy consumption, used when load is low

# Memory
- Virtual memory is used
	- Done by using the *page* model
	- Virtual space: m+1 pages
	- Physical space: page frames
- Physical memory is split into kernel space and user space
- Each process has a page table

- Pages have flags
	- A: accessed recently
	- M: modified
	- P: present
		- if the page is present in the memory

# I/O devices
- Drivers (family of-)
- disk scheduling
- RAID (NOT ON EXAM)
