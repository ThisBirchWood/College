- TinyOS and MobileOS have scarce resources
- Advantages of components and why they're used
	- Flexibility
	- Can be upgraded
	- Modularity
	- Handlers for commands
	- Handlers for events
	- Tasks
- Android must react immediately to touchscreen
	- Apps in Android are also component based
	- Execution control can be switched from one app to another (between processes)
		- Intents are used to do this (Intents are a kind of inter-process communication)
		- Explicit = within the same process, Implicit = outside of the current process (generally, not all the time)
	- A *task* is a *stack* of activities
	- Activity life cycle is about visibility
		- 3 states of an activity: visible, not visible and running
		- The activity life cycle sits on top of the process life cycle
- child processes are created with:
	- fork()
		- Simple but time consuming (copies the entire image of present process)
	- vfork()
		- process is suspended and child uses parents memory image
	- clone()
		- Some resources are shared, others are copied
	1) Get an id (PiD)
	2) Copy memory image
	3) Copy its context into the process table
