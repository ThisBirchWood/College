- Processes of lower priorities have a higher time share of the CPU
- If a process has an I/O operation, the CPU blocks that process
	- The CPU will wait a certain amount of time before resuming that process
		- By "wait" I mean complete other processes
- A *critical region* is the code where a process is managing a *critical resource* (e.g, printers, disks)
- A process can enter a *critical region* and need the CPU
	- No other process can access the *critical resource* while 
	- Even if a process with a higher priority needs it, it can't access it
	- The *kernel* will intervene and raise the priority of the process with the *critical resource*, so it can complete it's task
	
- The *idle* process takes control if there are no other processes to run
- Quantum (time slice) for process with priority 0 is 20ms
	- Process with priority 1 is 40ms
	- Process with priority 2 is 80ms...
	- Processes with lower priority get a higher timeshare
- Once a process completes one time share in the CPU, it moves down the priority queue.
