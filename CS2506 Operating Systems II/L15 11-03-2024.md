- Device controller is a set of control registers that are used to set up a device
	- These can be mapped to the main memory
- The device driver runs in the kernel
- Main purpose of a driver is to allow any process to use a device it controls

- Say that PID 223 wants to print a file
- What info would the driver be given?
	- **starting address** in memory of the file to printed
	- size
	- printer -> driver
- The driver setups up the *controller* of the printer, 
	- Also handles *interrupts* raised by the controller

```
- Drivers for the same type of devices, can be grouped into a *family* of drivers
	- abstracts the generic device of that particular type (its common denominator)
		- set of operations & protocols
	- each individual driver *inherits* these characteristics and implements them
- You can have different drivers for the same device
	- Some might have lower latency, etc

- "Each layer is a client of the layer below it and a provider of services to the layer above it."
	- Say we have a family of drivers, *storage family drivers*
		- And **Storage Device A's** driver inherits from the generic *storage* driver
		- Storage family shares all *data structures* and *set of operations*
		- access point 2: protocol for device A

- Say process A is running, and then it has an I/O operation (read)
- Control is given to the driver
	- Which receives the parameters (inputs) from Process A, which includes:
		- address of the input buffer
		- address on the disk (where data is read from)
		- data size
	- Those parameters are converted such that the controller understands them
	- Then the request is added to a queue
		- Which is enacted immediately due to no other processes using the device (presumably)
	- The driver initiates the I/O operation (read)
- Say Process B needs a write operation
	- The same thing happens, though when it's queued, it waits until the first one is finished
	- This causes Process B to be blocked
- Once Process A is finished reading, the controller issues an *interrupt*, to let the system know immediately
