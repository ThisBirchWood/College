- Memory management
	- page frame
	- pages belonging to the virtual space
- System needs evidence of free space
	- System uses bitmap to track free space
	- Bit flag for each page frame (free/not free)
- Main memory is a set of blocks (of different sizes)
- How find free blocks?
	- A list
	- This list is also store in the free blocks

- Block A - 4 pages (16KB)
- Block B - 16 pages (64KB)
- Block X - 256 pages (1MB)

- Say if main memory was 8GB, we could have 8 blocks of 1GB
- What if the first process only needs 64KB
	- It will split a block to the desired size
- Using blocks is more efficient due to the fact that if the entire main memory was split into pages, it would be difficult to manage
	- 8GB is 2 million pages (hard to manage)

- Fragmentation is when the memory allocated to a process doesn't match its size exactly, fragmentation also consumes more energy
	- Internal:
		- Process requires 11KB
		- System allocates 16KB
		- 5KB is unused
		- This is known as internal fragmentation
	- External:
		- When some blocks of certain sizes aren't required and they're skipped
	- The OS avoids fragmentation as much as possible

- After a while, the memory begins to look like Swiss cheese, with holes all over the place (hehe)
```slide-note

```
- Many people consider *best fit* to be the most efficient overall
- *Worst fit* minimizes external fragmentation when blocks are of similar size
```slide-note
page: 8
```
- This is the most popular strategy used (used by Linux)

- Example:
	- 4GB main memory, split into blocks of 1GB
	
	- Process needs 30MB
	- Since the buddy system works in powers of 2, 32MB would work
	- 1GB = 512MB, 512MB
		- 512MB = 256MB, 256MB
		- And so on, until it reaches 32MB
	- Then 32MB is allocated
	- The other blocks that were created, are free
		- Normally these merge if unused
		- Only blocks of the same size can merge

	- If another process needs 129MB
	- It could use a 256MB block, created in the allocation of memory to the earlier process, this has significant internal fragmentation

```
- Initially the memory is clear, memory is made up of 
	- Pages
	- Blocks of pages
- If memory is fully allocated, but there are blocked processes, their memory blocks are good candidates for *swapping*
	- Memory blocks are swapped to disk, assuming they're not shared blocks
	- When a process becomes unblocked, *some* of it's memory blocks are reloaded into main memory
