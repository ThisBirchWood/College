- Main memory split into kernel + user area
	- Main processes in user area (memory images of processes)
- Kernel processes -> services
- If a certain process is using the CPU, we say that process has **control** of the system

# Child Processes
- Copies the parent process and the context and get a new process id

# Threads
- Each thread has it's own thread id, though it's all still part of the one process
- Has it's own context (extended from the context of the process)
