- Main memory
	- physical memory contains:
		- kernel space
		- user space
			- user space starts off empty, and uses a **bitmap** to keep track of the allocated page frames
	- virtual memory 
		- used because we don't want the constraints of the physical space
		- uses disk to make main memory appear bigger
		- program space independent of the physical space
- OS needs a system to convert a virtual memory address to a physical memory address
	- Page mapping
	- Pages in the virtual memory -> (converted to) page frames in the physical memory
	- We can now accommodate processes with a very large virtual space in the physical memory, without running out of space

- Page Frame = unallocated fixed-size piece of memory that can *host* a page

Example for **page tables**:
- Virtual address: 64 bits
- page: 4KB (12 bits)
- The remaining 52 bits of the address are used as an index for the page table
- In the page table, you have the index and the address is the physical address for the page frame
- If the physical memory doesn't contain the page, this is a **page fault** (we know this because the P(present) flag is 0, indicating that it's not present in the main memory)
	- Bring the page from the disk, to the page frame
	- The question is, where to place the page frame
		- System needs to invoke the kernel service of **memory allocation**
	- Once a suitable memory location is found, it's entry in the page table is updated
	- What if the entire main memory is already allocated?
		- **Page Replacement**

- Each process has a **working set**
	- A number of pages required to execute
	- If a process has a lot of page faults, we can increase the size of the working set
	- More pages are allocated to this process

- The entire main memory is organized as a set of pages
- However pages can be too small, too cumbersome if programs needs MBs, or GBs
	- We can group them into **blocks** of *variable size*
		- Block of Type 1 = 4 pages 
			- All blocks of type 1 will have 4 pages
		- Block of Type 2 = 16 pages
		- Block of Type 3 = 64 pages
		- Block of Type 4 = 256 pages (1MB)
	- Easier to manage a smaller number 
		- Instead of having to manage 1 million pages, we can break that down to only managing 1000 blocks or so

- Buddy System
	- 8GB main memory, split into blocks of size 1GB
	- What if a process needs 2MB
		- Split a random block, 1GB = 512MB, 512MB
		- 512MB = 256MB, 256MB
		- And so on, until we reach 2MB, or is closest to matching what's needed
	- All the other blocks created during the splitting are free, therefore it's not fragmented because they can be allocated
		- They can *merge* with their **buddies**
