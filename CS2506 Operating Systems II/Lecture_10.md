- Android Runtime has faster execution
- App is identified in the system by an app ID
	- an app is equivalent to a process
	- inside the app are activities that make up the application
	- each activity can be an entry point into the app (no main() function)
- Graph of time access app (process)
	- at time slice 1: app is created (resources are allocated)
	- next time slice: app is visible (on the screen)
	- next: application is running and interacting with user
	- app is terminated
	- each time slice is greater than the previous as app is getting requeued
- URL specifies the location of a resource on the internet, while a URI can be used to identify any type of resource, not just those on the internet
- intent purpose is to address the next component to execute - can be within the same process or in a different process
- intent is a mechanism for inter-process communication
- start the app(A) -> new task is created by Android
	- task manages execution flow by using a stack
	- each activity goes into the stack
	- we can go up or down the stack
	- when a new app is run the stack of the previous application is still kept in memory
	- After some time, if Android is looking for memory, it will trim stack to the root activity
