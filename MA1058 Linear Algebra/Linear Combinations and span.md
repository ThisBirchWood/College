# Linear Combinations
- Say we have a a set of vectors in R^n
	- v1, v2, ..........., v(n)
- A linear combination is simply adding all of those vectors together, while they're being multiplied by a constant in R.

- Take an example, a = (1, 2) and b = (0, 3)
	- These two vectors when put in a linear combination, could represent any vector in R^2. 
	- Therefore, the **span** of a, b is all of R^2
- Another example, a = (2, 2) and b = (-2, -2)
	- These vectors cannot represent any vector
	- The span is a,b is just t multiplied by a (aka the line represented by A)

# Spans
- A span is the set of all vectors that can be represented by a linear combination.
