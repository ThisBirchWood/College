- Big Data refers to the large volumes of *structured, semi-structured* and *unstructured* data that is collected on a day to day basis
- Many technologies collect this type of data:
	- Sensors
	- NFC
	- Barcodes
	- Localising (GPS, Wi-Fi)
	- Video recognition
	- Car-based computing

# Six V's
## Volume
- Big Data involves huge amounts of data that traditional data processing systems would struggle to handle
- Examples:
	- Patient records
	- Social Networks
	- Transactions
- 1MB = 1,000,000 bytes
## Velocity
- Big Data is generated and processed rapidly
- Examples:
	- Batch
	- Real-Time
	- Streaming

## Variety
- Big Data can come in structured, semi-structured and unstructured types
- **Unstructured data** takes up the most space by far (80% +)
### Structured
- Well-defined model and structures
- Such as databases
### Semi-structured
- Apparent patterns
- XML + Spreadsheets
### Unstructured
- No structure in different types
- texts, PDFs, images and videos

## Veracity
- The degree of trust on big data
	- Authenticity
	- Availability
	- Accountability
	- Trustworthiness
## Variability
- Shifts in data
## Value
- Extraction of valuable insights and knowledge from data


Abbreviation (to remember easily): VVVVVV
# Things to consider
- What are some things we have to consider with big data:
	- Improving performance of databases
	- Supporting concurrency on servers
		- Or parallel processing across several servers
	- Supporting scalability using **distributed databases**
	- Ingesting and securing our data
	- Anonymize our data
