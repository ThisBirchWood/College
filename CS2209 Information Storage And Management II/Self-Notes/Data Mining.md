- The processing of extracting valid, previously unknown, comprehensible information from large databases and using it to make critical business decisions

# CRISP-DM
- CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) consists of six major phases:
	1) **Business Understanding**: Understanding the problem and why it's important for business. Understanding business weaknesses and strengths
	2) **Data Understanding**: Analysis of the data and understanding and being knowledgeable on what is contains. Is it good quality? Does is have any errors?
	3) **Data Preparation**: Clean up the data to get it ready for analysis. This would involve fixing errors and making it easy to work with.
	4) **Modelling**: Use the prepared data to build models that can help answer the questions asked in phase one.
	5) **Evaluation**: This stage involves just inspecting and evaluating the models to ensure that they're achieving the business goals. Sometimes there might be an important business issue not being considered.
	6) **Deployment**: Once a company is happy with a model, it can be put to use to make business decisions that are useful to the consumer and business.

# Data Mining Tasks
## Regression
- Predicting data based on changes in other data.
- Regression helps us understand how one variable (like price) changes relative to other variables (like time or demand)

## Classification
- Learning rules that separate objects of different types from one another
- Examples:
	- Disease diagnosis
	- Spam email detection

## Clustering
- The opposite of classification, this involves finding groups of similar objects
- Examples:
	- People with similar "preferences"
	- Genes with similar functions
